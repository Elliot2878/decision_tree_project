After initial diagnostic workup, What are the clinical findings?
--If Monoclonal gammopathies of clinical significance, Is it Monoclonal Gammopathy of Renal Significance (MGRS) or Monoclonal Gammopathy of Neurological Significance (MGNS)?
----If MGRS, Evaluate for kidney disease by analyzing kidney function: eGFR, urinalysis and metabolic testing. Is AKI stage 3, eGFR <60 mL/min and >2ml/min per year decline, Proteinuria (>1 g/day), Albumin:creatinine >30mg/mmol, and Fanconi syndrome OR is AKI stage 1 or 2, eGFR <60 mL/min and <2 mL/min per year decline, Albumin:creatinine 3–30mg/mmol and GFR <60mL/min, Evidence of light chain proteinuria OR is eGFR stable, urinalysis normal and no evidence of light chain proteinuria?
------If AKI stage 1 or 2, eGFR <60 mL/min and <2 mL/min per year decline, Albumin:creatinine 3–30mg/mmol and GFR <60mL/min, Evidence of light chain proteinuria, Consider renal biopsy.After confirm diagnosis of MGRS by: Light microscopy. Immunofluorescence staining for IgG subclasses, IgA and IgM, and kappa and lambda Note: M protein detected in serum and/or urine must match the one found in the renal biopsy. Electron microscopy. PET/CT, low-dose CT, or whole-body MRI as clinically indicated. Bone marrow biopsy if suspected to have MM or WM. Do additional workup as clinically indicated. After, for treatment is MGRS lgG, lgA, or FLC MGRS?
--------If Yes, perform myeloma therapy, Is the patient a transplant candidate?
----------If No, Is the patient frail?
------------If No (frail score <2), Does the patient have either renal insufficiency or peripheral neuropathy?
--------------If Yes, Does the patient have acute renal insufficiency or have chronic renal insufficiency and/or peripheral neuropathy?
----------------If Acute Renal Insufficiency, The initial treatment for the patient is Bortezomib/Cyclophosphamide/Dexamethasone. After improvement of the renal function, the treatment for the patient is Bortezomib/Lenalidomide/Dexamethasone. With Myeloma therapy done, Perform follow-up/surveillance as follows: [(Laboratory assessments appropriate for monitoring treatment toxicities may include: CBC, differential, platelet count, blood glucose and electrolytes, and metabolic panel),(Serum quantitative immunoglobulins, SPEP, and SIFE),(24-h urine for total protein, UPEP, and UIFE at baseline and as clinically indicated or if there is a significant change in FLC levels),(Serum FLC assay),(Whole-body imaging with MRI without contrast, low-dose CT scan, FDG PET/CT annually or as clinically indicated, ideally with the same technique used at diagnosis),(Bone marrow aspirate and biopsy at relapse with FISH as clinically indicated),(Assess for hematopoietic cell transplant candidacy: Refer for evaluation at a hematopoietic cell transplant center. Harvest hematopoietic stem cells (consider for 2 transplants if appropriate),(Consider minimal residual disease (MRD) as indicated for prognostication after shared decision with patient),(See NCCN Guidelines for Survivorship)] After completetion of follow-up/surveillance, analyze for response. Was there a response?
------------------If Yes, Regardless of transplant or therapy perform follow-up/surveillance by: • Laboratory assessments appropriate for monitoring treatment toxicities may include: CBC, differential, platelet count, blood glucose and electrolytes, and metabolic panel. • Serum quantitative immunoglobulins, SPEP, and SIFE. • 24-h urine for total protein, UPEP, and UIFE at baseline and as needed or if there is a significant change in FLC levels. • Serum FLC assay. • Whole-body advanced imaging with FDG PET/CT, low-dose CT scan, MRI without contrast as needed, ideally with the same technique used at diagnosis. • Bone marrow aspirate and biopsy with multi-parameter flow cytometry as needed. • Consider MRD as indicated for prognostication aftershared decision with patient. Afterwards, is treatment needed for post-transplant or for relapsed/progressive diseases after continuous/maintenance myeloma therapy without prior transplant?
--------------------If For post-transplant, Is it for a Post-autologous hematopoietic cell transplant (single or tandem) or Post-allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant?
----------------------If Post-allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant, is it a Progressive disease or a Response/Stable disease?
------------------------If Progressive disease, Perform additional treatment by therapy for previously treated myeloma, or through a clinical trial or through Donor lymphocyte infusion.
