After initial diagnostic workup, What are the clinical findings?
--If Multiple Myeloma (symptomatic), Perform primary treatment through myeloma therapy. Is the patient a transplant candidate?
----If Yes, Is the patient frail?
------If No (frail score <2), Does the patient have either renal insufficiency or peripheral neuropathy?
--------If No, Is the patient standard or high risk?
----------If Standard risk, The treatments for the patient are Bortezomib/Lenalidomide/Dexamethasone combination or Carfilzomib/Lenalidomide/Dexamethasone or Carfilzomib/Lenalidomide/Bortezomib/Dexamethasone or Ixazomib/Lenalidomide/Dexamethasone. With Myeloma therapy done, Perform follow-up/surveillance as follows: [(Laboratory assessments appropriate for monitoring treatment toxicities may include: CBC, differential, platelet count, blood glucose and electrolytes, and metabolic panel),(Serum quantitative immunoglobulins, SPEP, and SIFE),(24-h urine for total protein, UPEP, and UIFE at baseline and as clinically indicated or if there is a significant change in FLC levels),(Serum FLC assay),(Whole-body imaging with MRI without contrast, low-dose CT scan, FDG PET/CT annually or as clinically indicated, ideally with the same technique used at diagnosis),(Bone marrow aspirate and biopsy at relapse with FISH as clinically indicated),(Assess for hematopoietic cell transplant candidacy: Refer for evaluation at a hematopoietic cell transplant center. Harvest hematopoietic stem cells (consider for 2 transplants if appropriate),(Consider minimal residual disease (MRD) as indicated for prognostication after shared decision with patient),(See NCCN Guidelines for Survivorship)] After completetion of follow-up/surveillance, analyze for response. Was there a response?
------------If No, Perform therapy for previously treated myeloma or consider a clinical trial. With refractory disease and lack of treatment options, refer to palliative care.
