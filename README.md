# decision_tree_project

A software takes text input and converts it into a dynamic decision tree. It has a wide range of applications, including myeloma diagnosis, student visa, etc. The purpose of the dynamic decision tree is not to make inferences like other decision tree models such as random forest decision trees or CART method decision trees. Instead this decision tree is purely a decision assistance/making software made to be easy to use, understand, and interact with.


To run the code, you should create a virtual environment, activate the virtual environment, install flask, and run the app.py
